The annual list focuses on highlighting 40 individuals who are making a difference in Chicago business and non-profits. Dr. Rogalski was recognized as a disruptor who is “upsetting the status quo” through her groundbreaking work with SuperAgers. Instead of focusing on what goes wrong when it comes to aging and memory, Dr. Rogalski decided to focus on the positive outcomes. This turned the tables on how scientists approach Alzheimer’s disease, dementia and memory loss.</p>

This award will coalesce and coordinate informatics activities across the Clinical and Translational Science Award (CTSA) Program, a network of more than 50 medical research institutions, to provide collaborative clinical and translational research infrastructure.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The new CTSA Program National Center for Data to Health will be led by Dr. Melissa Haendel (OHSU), Dr. Kristi Holmes (Northwestern University), Dr. Sean Mooney (University of Washington), Dr. Christopher Chute (Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine), and John Wilbanks (Sage Bionetworks). These institutions, together with The Scripps Research Institute, Washington University in St. Louis, the University of Iowa, and The Jackson Laboratory will work with CTSA Program hubs and the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) at the National Institutes of Health to launch the CD2H.</p>
<p>“The new National Center for Data to Health offers an opportunity to catalyze the cultural and technological changes necessary for data and informatics to fundamentally impact research and health care,” describes Dr. Kristi Holmes, associate professor in the Department of Preventive Medicine, director of evaluation at NUCATS, and director of the Galter Health Sciences Library &amp; Learning Center at Feinberg School of Medicine, who is a co-director of the new center. “As scientific research is transformed by big data, high-performance computing, and real-time publishing, the structure and composition of scientific teamwork is also changing. Here we aim to grow the data and informatics-based architecture needed to support interdisciplinary teams so that diverse contributions are valued and recognized -- enhancing knowledge transfer, discovery, and impact on health.”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>The CD2H will be tasked with several priorities to support a vibrant and evolving informatics ecosystem, including: support and enhancement of a collaborative informatics community; development of Good Data Practice (GDP); promotion of software standards for interoperability; growth of collaborative innovation across informatics tools, methods, and processes; advancement of cutting edge biomedical research informatics; data science education for CTSA Program researchers; and novel methods and tools for the evaluation of the impact of these activities to enhance health care through data and informatics.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Donald Lloyd-Jones, MD, ScM, senior associate dean for Clinical and Translational Research and director of the Northwestern University Clinical and Translational Sciences Institute (NUCATS) explained the impact of this program. “Today’s researchers and physicians can leverage data and technology in ways never before imagined possible. Critical infrastructure, such as our own Northwestern Medicine Enterprise Data Warehouse, powers transformative research, clinical trials, clinical quality improvement, health care operations, and medical education initiatives -- enabling us to truly realize the vision of a vibrant learning healthcare system. A strong, collaborative national informatics infrastructure is a critical component to support this work and drive healthcare and research to the next level. We are thrilled for Northwestern to play a leadership role on this important effort.”</p>
<p>The newly created center will focus on creating and harnessing an ecosystem for translational scientists to discover and share their software, data, and other research resources within the CTSA Program network. The CD2H also creates a social coding environment for translational science institutions, leveraging the community-driven DREAM challenges as a mechanism to stimulate innovation. Collaborative innovation also serves as a strong foundation to support mechanisms to facilitate training, engagement, scholarly dissemination, and impact across the CTSA Program hubs and beyond.</p>
<p>“The goal of the CD2H is to unlock the amazing wealth of technologies and innovation located within each individual CTSA and to create cohesive communities of practice founded on the fundamental premise that team science, data sharing, and collaborative innovation can advance patient care” described the center director at Oregon Health &amp; Sciences University, Dr. Melissa Haendel, who also co-directs the NCATS Biomedical Data Translator program. &nbsp;Professor Christopher Chute, Chief Research Information Officer at Johns Hopkins Medicine and Deputy Director of the Johns Hopkins Institute for Clinical and Translational Research described the important role that collaborative informatics plays in health. “All CTSA hubs have shared an aspiration for federated analyses of clinical data across the network, married with public repositories of basic science data, to achieve unprecedented levels of biomedical knowledge discovery and improved practice. &nbsp;CD2H will catalyze this process, and coordinate the myriad of social, legal, and technical requirements to make this practical.”</p>
<p>The Northwestern University Clinical and Translational Sciences Institute is positioned as the home base for clinical and translational science at Northwestern University and its clinical affiliates. NUCATS functions as an integrated hub supporting and accelerating clinical and translational science across Northwestern University (including six schools), our three nationally-renowned clinical partners, our Chicago community and stakeholders, and the broad consortium of CTSA-funded institutions. NUCATS is currently funded, in part, by the NCATS research grant UL1TR001422.

The KL2 award is a multidisciplinary mentored career development program which will provide Sadiya Khan, MD, MS, Assistant Professor of Medicine (Cardiology) and Tracy Gertler, MD, PhD, Instructor of Pediatrics (Neurology) with career development resources, educational opportunities, salary support and career guidance.</p>
<p><strong>Sadiya Khan, MD, MS, Assistant Professor of Medicine (Cardiology)</strong><br>Dr. Khan will use this award to foster her scientific and professional development into an independent physician-scientist and a leader in translational cardiometabolic research. With the help of her mentors, Drs. Lloyd-Jones, Vaughan, and Hou, she has designed a specific training plan to build upon her background in basic and epidemiologic investigation that involves didactic coursework, analytic experience through a supervised research project, and interaction with a multidisciplinary team of sponsors with expertise in cardiovascular epidemiology, vascular biology, and epigenetics.</p>
<p>The overall scientific goal of this project is to investigate the role of DNA methylation in the development of cardiometabolic diseases across the lifecourse utilizing both candidate-pathway approach (adipogenesis pathways) and epigenome-wide association studies in two complementary cohorts, including the Coronary Artery Disease Risk in Young Adults and an Old Order Amish cohort.</p>
<p><strong>Tracy Gertler, MD, PhD, Instructor of Pediatrics (Neurology)</strong><br>Dr. Gertler will use KL2 funding to further investigate the relationship between Malignant migrating partial epilepsy of infancy (MMPEI) a type of epileptic encephalopathy (EE) and a gain-of-function mutation within the KCNT1 gene encoding Slack, a sodium-activated potassium channel. Quinidine has been reported as a uniquely efficacious anticonvulsant, suggesting that targeting neuronal excitability in EE is therapeutically beneficial, yet its use is limited by non-specific channel block in the brain and heart. Advances in EE are further complicated by a lack of understanding of the neuronal subtype within the brain driving the epileptogenic circuit. This project seeks to delineate the molecular mechanisms governing gain-of-function of Slack channels in a mammalian heterologous expression system and in human neurons differentiated from patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), representing a novel attempt to model pathogenic ion channels in mammalian cells and human neurons.</p>
<p>Automated electrophysiology will be used to screen a limited panel of potassium channel blockers and quinidine-like compounds to identify selective and potent blockers of Slack channels for use in additional experiments as well as potential therapies for MMPEI. By identifying the mechanism of ‘overactive’ Slack channels and developing a select panel of drugs which block its gain-of-function, she hopes to refine a more precise approach to treating patients with severe global impairment and intractable epilepsy due to KCNT1 mutation.</p></div></li><li><div class="newsTitle" id="n20170809"><a href="http://">INVOForward Kick Off Meeting is Fast Approaching</a></div><div class="newsDate">08.09.2017</div><div class="newsDetail"><p>The kick off meeting for the first cohort of INVOForward is September 8.&nbsp; INVO is currently wrapping up interviews of teams who are interested in commercializing MEDICAL DEVICES.&nbsp; Approximately 20 teams from Feinberg, McCormick, Lurie Children’s and Ability Lab are vying to participate in this selective program.&nbsp; INVOForward is a Northwestern mentorship program to accelerate biomedical commercialization, such as medical devices, therapeutics, and Health IT, on both Evanston and Chicago campuses.</p>
